# Randan
_A python package for the analysis of sociological data_

### Overview

### Installation
Currently, `randan` is **unavailable** to install by `pip`. However, you can use two options to download our package:

1. download it manually by using `Clone or download` -> `Download ZIP` and unzip the downloaded archive in a desired folder
2. download it automatically by running `!git clone https://github.com/LanaLob/randan.git` in Jupyter Notebook. This will create a local copy of the current version of our package on your computer. To specify any particular folder for the package, modify this command as follows: `!git clone https://github.com/LanaLob/randan.git [desired path]`. If you have troubles with `git`, try to install it from the [official source](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (you likely have to restart your computer afterwards).

We recommend using the second way and clone our package every time you're going to use it as it allows you to have all the updates in time.

Once you have the package in the folder, you can import as any python package:

```python
# like this
import randan
# or like this
from randan.tree import CHAIDRegressor
# etc.
```
